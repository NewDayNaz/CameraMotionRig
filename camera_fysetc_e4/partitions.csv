# OTA partition table - requires otadata, ota_0 and ota_1 partitions (no factory partition)
# Configured for 16MB flash: each OTA partition is 2MB (0x200000) - total 4MB for OTA
# This provides plenty of headroom for ~931KB binary and future growth
# Note: App partitions (ota_0, ota_1) must be aligned to 64KB (0x10000) boundaries
# Layout: nvs (16KB) -> otadata (8KB) -> phy_init (4KB) -> ota_0 (2MB aligned) -> ota_1 (2MB)
