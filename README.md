## What is this?
This is the code driving the pan/tilt/zoom motorized camera rig that was built to reduce the number of operators required to create more dynamic livestreams for the church.

It is important to note this was written and iterated on at location and I didn't have much time to clean it up as I needed to get an MVP ready fairly quickly, I plan to eventually refactor and redesign the code whenever I get the chance. 

## How do these services work together?
